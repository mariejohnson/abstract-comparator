       "  'abstract': 'Challenges and opportunities coexist in microgrids as a result of emerging large-scale distributed energy resources (DERs) and advanced control techniques. In this paper, a comprehensive review of microgrid control is presented with its fusion of model-free reinforcement learning (MFRL). A high-level research map of microgrid control is developed from six distinct perspectives, followed by bottom-level modularized control blocks illustrating the configurations of grid-following (GFL) and grid-forming (GFM) inverters. Then, mainstream MFRL algorithms are introduced with an explanation of how MFRL can be integrated into the existing control framework. Next, the application guideline of MFRL is summarized with a discussion of three fusing approaches, i.e., model identification and parameter tuning, supplementary signal generation, and controller substitution, with the existing control framework. Finally, the fundamental challenges associated with adopting MFRL in microgrid control and corresponding insights for addressing these concerns are fully discussed.'},\n",

       "  'authors': 'Yujian Ye, Dawei Qiu, Xiaodong Wu, Goran Strbac, Jonathan Ward',\n",
       "  'abstract': \"Multi-energy systems (MES) are attracting increasing attention driven by its potential to offer significant flexibility in future smart grids. At the residential level, the roll-out of smart meters and rapid deployment of smart energy devices call for autonomous multi-energy management systems which can exploit real-time information to optimally schedule the usage of different devices with the aim of minimizing end-users' energy costs. This paper proposes a novel real-time autonomous energy management strategy for a residential MES using a model-free deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based approach, combining state-of-the-art deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) method with an innovative prioritized experience replay strategy. This approach is tailored to align with the nature of the problem by posing it in multi-dimensional continuous state and action spaces, facilitating more cost-effective control strategies to be devised. The superior performance of the proposed approach in reducing end-user's energy cost while coping with the MES uncertainties is demonstrated by comparing it against state-of-the-art DRL methods as well as conventional stochastic programming and robust optimization methods in numerous case studies in a real-world scenario.\"}]"
